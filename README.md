Welcome to my Github profile, my name is Gabriel Weindel (he/him) and I'm a cognitive scientist looking for my next project.

I am mainly interested in nerdy stuff about computational models of cognition 
(especially decision making) and Bayesian statistics. As a trained neuropsychologist, my interest goes also to cognitive deficits associated with clinical conditions such as mental illness and brain injuries as I think that, in the long tradition of neuropsychologist, care of patients goes along with advance in scientific knowledge.
